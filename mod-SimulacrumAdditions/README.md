## Augments
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be guaranteed on wave 50, and every 30 waves after that.

Starting on wave 50, every stage will spawn a ending portal to end a run peacefully.

This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal and makes the gamemode "beatable".\
One of these runs should take around an hour (similiar to loop Mithrix) and counts as a win.  

__Adds a very large amount of Augments:__\
In total raises Basic Augment count from 9 to 65 (+9 with supported mods).\
In total raises Boss Augment count from 5 to 30 (+1 with supported mods).

Basic Augments :
- 6 Artifact Augments. (+5 with mods)
- 13 Family Event Augments. (+3 with mods)
- 5 Item Augments.
- 3 Equipment Augments.
- 6 Buff Augments.
- 4 Pulse Augments.
- 3 Elite Augments.
- 16 Other Augments. (+1 with mods)

Boss Augments :
- 8 Specific Boss Augments.
- 5 Boss Artifact Augments.
- 2 Boss Family Augment. (+1 with mods)
- 1 Boss Elite Augment.
- 3 Boss Item Augment.
- 7 Other Boss Augments.

## Simulacrum Quality of Life

Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool. This makes each stage feel more unique.\
Shrine of Chance, Woods, Order, Cleansing Pools, Void Potential chests now spawn in the game mode because of this.

Reintroduces the unused Void Marker Coin.
- Can be used as an alternative to blood on void interactables in Simulacrum.
- Drop like Lunar Coin and from Void Barrels. You start with 1.
- This is mostly to make Simulacrum easier. Allowing purchases of Void interactables deep in the void without worry.

QoL for The Focus / Crab:
- Radius is slightly bigger and increases in size per player.
- Radius is 50% bigger during travelling.
- Radius expands after sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions.
- It will not begin travelling on it's own, instead waiting for you to activate it. So you can loot in peace before moving on
- Focus moves faster the more waves are completed. Less waiting time
- For each stage completed, -0.8 second between regular waves.

The latest wave will be shown on the game end screen.

Fireworks are now available in Simulacrum for VanillaVoids support.\
Warbanners drop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.

## Artifacts
__Adds 2 Simulacrum only Artifacts__

Artifact of Augments  | Only augmented waves. For when the normal ~50% chance isn't enough for you.

Artifact of Reality | Any stage can be used instead of the small set of Simulacrum stages.
- Stages will use Simu-Stage skybox.
- Stage order is still random.
- Void Fields and Void Locust can appear too.
- Newt Shrines replaced with Void Eradicators.
- Safe radius is larger to account for less compatible stages


Nerfs Artifact of Sacrifice in Simulacrum. (Only 2 options per potential)

Artifact of Devotion now works in Simulacrum:
- Eggs can spawn despite no drones being in the game mode.
- Lemurians evolve every boss wave

#

## Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like how final bosses on normal runs do.\
This scaling is lessened if they're not the 'Final Boss' wave.\
Some special Boss Augments now spawn with enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages reward more money.\
Stage 5+ get less interactables.\
You get more gold and more interactables will spawn in multiplayer

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4 then 2 waves, shortening after each red is added.\

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.\
Really early waves even less because of how often flying enemies overwhelm the player.


#

## Miscellaneous


More enemy types are added to the spawn pool starting wave 21.\
Void enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 61.

Augmented waves will get likelier after wave 30 and wave 50.

Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.\
Simulacrum has a small chance to add a void item to enemies.  

There's a void themed teleport effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.

You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Abyssal Depths has new Geysers for better navigation\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Siphoned Forests music\
Simu Commencement has ramps, a rim and moon gravity.
