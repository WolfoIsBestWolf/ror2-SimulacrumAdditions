### Augments
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be guaranteed on wave 50, and every 30 waves after that. (they can still rarely occur randomly).  

Starting on wave 50, every stage a ending portal will spawn to end a run peacefully.\
This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal and makes the gamemode "beatable".\
One of these runs should take around an hour (similiar to loop Mithrix) and counts as a win.  

__Adds a very large amount of Augments__\
In total raises Basic Augment count from 9 to 65 (+9 with supported mods).\
In total raises Boss Augment count from 5 to 30 (+1 with supported mods).\

- 5 Item Augments.\
- 3 Equipment Augments.\

### Quality of Life

Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool. This makes each stage feel more unique.\
This also means Shrine of Chance, Woods, Order and Cleansing Pools now spawn in the game mode.

Reintroduces the unused Void Coin. They can be used as an alternative to blood on void interactables in Simulacrum.\
They drop like Lunar Coin and from Void Barrels. You start with 1.
This is mostly to make Simulacrum easier. Allowing purchases of Void interactables deep in the void without worry.

The focus radius is slightly bigger and increases in size per player.\
The focus radius is 50% bigger during travelling.\
The focus radius expands after sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions in Meadows/Depths.\
The focus will not begin travelling on it's own, instead waiting for you to activate it.\
The focus moves faster the more waves are completed.\
For each stage completed, -0.8 second between regular waves.

The latest wave will be shown on the game end screen.

Fireworks are now available in Simulacrum for VanillaVoids support.\
Warbanners drop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.
#

### Artifacts
Adds 2 Simulacrum only Artifacts:

Artifact of Augments : Only augmented waves. For when the normal ~50% chance isn't enough for you.

Artifact of Reality : Use normal stages in random order instead of the small set of Simulacrum stages.\
-Void Fields and Void Locust can appear too.\
-Stage order is still random.\
-Newt Shrines replaced with Void Eradicators.

Nerfs Artifact of Sacrifice in Simulacrum. (Only 2 options per potential)
#

### Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like how final bosses on normal runs do.\
Special Boss Augments now spawn with enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages reward more money.\
Stage 5+ get less interactables.\
You get more gold and more interactables will spawn in multiplayer

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4 then 2 waves, shortening after each red is added.\
Enemies are no longer granted useless items such as Regenerative Scrap, Sale Star, Sonch Whispers, War Bonds.\
Shuriken, Singularity Band, Nkuhanas Opinion are blacklisted for enemies now.

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.\
Really early waves even less because of how often flying enemies overwhelm the player.

#

### Miscellaneous

Makes Artifact of Devotion functional in the game mode. (Eggs spawn despite no drones, evolves every boss wave)

More enemy types are added to the spawn pool starting wave 21.\
Void enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 61.

Special waves will get likelier after wave 30 and wave 50.

Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.\
Simulacrum has a small chance to add a void item to enemies.  

There's a void themed teleport effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.\
Void Potentials use their respective tiers particle effects.\
Void Potentials display their content in ping messages

You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Abyssal Depths has new Geysers for better navigation\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Siphoned Forests music\
Simu Commencement has ramps, a rim and moon gravity. 


Fixes vanilla bug where Clients don't teleport to the Crab. Instead teleporting in the fog and dying.\
Fixed vanilla bug where Clients often don't get enemy indicators.

### Skins and Mod Support
For technical reasons the skins are their own mod, for more information on the skins goal to it's [mod page](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoAlternateSkins/ ):\
They aren't anything too special but I do hope they are still enjoyable. You can disable the mod if you really don't want it.\
[![wolfoAlternateSkins](https://gcdn.thunderstore.io/live/repository/icons/Wolfo-WolfoAlternateSkins-1.5.0.png.128x128_q95.jpg)](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoAlternateSkins/)

This mod depends on [VanillaArtifactsPlus](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/VanillaArtifactsPlus) for Devotion, Vengence and Item tag fixes. It's a rather light mod but you can check out the details on it's page.

This mod adds Augments for:\
[Starstorm2](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/), for it's Artifacts and some events it adds. (2 Augments)\
[LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/),for the new family events I add there. (5 Augments)\
[WolfoArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoArtifacts),  for the new artifacts I add there. (4 Augments)

A lot of things about this mod can be configured.

This mod has a auto generated config to turn off each individual wave.

#### Every player needs this mod installed.

Report bugs to @Wolfo.wolfo in the Risk of Rain 2 discord or RoR2 Modding discord.\
If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.\
Generally happy about gameplay feedback.


The balance of this mod can be questionable as Simulacrum sucks to balance and is far harder in Multiplayer.\
This mod currently is balanced to be rather difficult on Monsoon Multiplayer, difficulties like Typhoon and Inferno will not be accounted for.\


### Translations
Translations are possible as of version 2.3.0. None are included as of now.


##
I already make wave 50 special so [SimulacrumBossStageMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Def/SimulacrumBossStageMod/) is a bit redundant.\
I already speed up the crab so [SpeedUpSafeWard](https://thunderstore.io/package/Felix/SpeedUpSafeWard/) is redundant.
