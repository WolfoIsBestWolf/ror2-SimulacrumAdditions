## Simulacrum
Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool to make each stage feel more unique.\
This leads to interactables like Shrine of Chance, Shrine of Woods, Shrine of Order and Cleansing Pools and spawning in the game mode.

More enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 31, similiar to loop enemies.\
Void enemies can appear on every stage starting wave 71.

Basic Waves:  
-Added 11 Family Event Augments.   
-Added 5 Artifact Augments.   
-Added 3 Elite Augments.  
-Added 4 Unique Augments.  

Boss Waves:  
-Added 7 Special Boss Augments.  
-Added 4 Aritfact Boss Augments.  
-Added 3 Unique Boss Augments.  

Starting on wave 50, every stage a ending portal will spawn to end a run peacefully.  
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be forced on wave 50, reoccuring every 30 waves. (they can still occur randomly).  
This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal.

## Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like they have in the regular game.\
Special Boss Augments now spawn some enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages will have more Interactables to get a run going but less later to make late full looting not as extreme.\
More interactables will spawn in multiplayer

The focus moves faster the more waves are completed.\
For each stage completed, -1 second between regular waves.

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Enemies are likelier to get items they can actually use.\
Some items such as Tesla Coil, Nkuhanas and Spare Drone Parts are now blacklisted.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4/2/1 waves, shortening every time a red is added.\
Whites will be a stack of 3 and Greens a stack of 2 starting on wave 62.

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.

## Other  
Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.  

There's a void themed teleporte effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.  
Void Potentials use their respective tiers particle effects.  

The Focus is slighty bigger when moving and expands upon sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions in Meadows/Depths. 

You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Snowy Forests music

Fireworks is now an available item in Simulacrum.\
Warbanners pop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.
