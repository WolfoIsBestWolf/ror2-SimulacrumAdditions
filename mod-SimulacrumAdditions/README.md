## Simulacrum
Starting on wave 50, every stage a ending portal will spawn to end a run peacefully.  
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be forced on wave 50, reoccuring every 30 waves. (they can still occur randomly).  
This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal and makes the gamemode "beatable".  
One of these runs should take around an hour and counts as a win.  

Adds a large amount of Augments\
Basic Waves:  
-Added 12 Family Event Augments.   
-Added 5 Artifact Augments.   
-Added 3 Elite Augments.  
-Added 11 Other Augments.  

-In total raises Basic Augment count from 9 to 40 (+7 with supported mods).

Boss Waves:  
-Added 7 Special Boss Augments.  
-Added 4 Aritfact Boss Augments.  
-Added 4 Other Boss Augments.  

-In total raises Boss Augment count from 5 to 20 (+2 with supported mods).

Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool to make each stage feel more unique.\
This leads to interactables like Shrine of Chance, Shrine of Woods, Shrine of Order and Cleansing Pools spawning in the game mode.

More enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 21.\
Void enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 61.

## Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like they have in the regular game.\
Special Boss Augments now spawn with enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages will have more Interactables to get a run going but less later to make late full looting not as extreme.\
More interactables will spawn in multiplayer

The focus moves faster the more waves are completed.\
For each stage completed, -1 second between regular waves.

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4 then 2 waves, shortening after each red is added.\
Whites will be a stack of 3 and Greens a stack of 2 starting on wave 62.\
Some overpowered items were blacklisted for enemy team usage. (Tesla Coil, Nkuhanas)\

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.

Special waves will be much likelier after Wave 50.

## Other  
Void Coins can be used as an alternative to blood on void interactables in Simulacrum.\
They drop like Lunar Coin and from Void Barrels. You start with 1.\
Void Blood Payments can no longer be blocked (in Simu)

Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.\
Enemies have a small chance to get a void item.  

There's a void themed teleport effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.  
Void Potentials use their respective tiers particle effects.  

The Focus is slighty bigger when moving and expands upon sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions in Meadows/Depths. 

You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Snowy Forests music

Fireworks and Halcyon Seed are now available in Simulacrum.\
Warbanners pop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.
