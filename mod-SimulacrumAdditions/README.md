### Augments
Starting on wave 50, every stage a ending portal will spawn to end a run peacefully.  
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be forced on wave 50, reoccuring every 30 waves. (they can still rarely occur randomly).  
This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal and makes the gamemode "beatable".  
One of these runs should take around an hour (similiar to loop Mithrix) and counts as a win.

Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool to make each stage feel more unique.\
This means Shrine of Chance, Shrine of Woods, Shrine of Order and Cleansing Pools now spawn in the game mode.

Reintroduces the unused Void Coin. They can be used as an alternative to blood on void interactables in Simulacrum.\
They drop like Lunar Coin and from Void Barrels. You start with 1.\
Void Blood Payments can no longer be blocked. (in Simu only)
#
### Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like how final bosses on normal runs do.\
Special Boss Augments now spawn with enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages reward more money.\
Stage 5+ get less interactables.\
You get more gold and more interactables will spawn in multiplayer

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4 then 2 waves, shortening after each red is added.\
Enemies are no longer granted useless items such as On Kill items.\
Tesla Coil and Nkuhanas are blacklisted for enemies now.

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.\
Really early waves even less because of how often flying enemies overwhelm the player.

#
### Miscellaneous
Adds 2 Simulacrum only Artifacts:\
-Artifact of Augments : Only augmented waves\
-Artifact of Reality : Use normal stages instead of Simulacrum stages. (For people who really want Sulfur Pools for example)

Makes Artifact of Devotion and Delusion functional in the game mode.

More enemy types are added to the spawn pool starting wave 21.\
Void enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 61.

Special waves will get likelier after wave 30 and wave 50.

The focus radius is slightly bigger per player during waves.\
The focus radius is 50% bigger during travelling.\
The focus radius expands after sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions in Meadows/Depths.\
The focus will not begin travelling on it's own, instead waiting for you to activate it.\
The focus moves faster the more waves are completed.\
For each stage completed, -0.8 second between regular waves.

Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.\
Enemies have a small chance to get a void item.  

There's a void themed teleport effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.\
Void Potentials use their respective tiers particle effects.\
Void Potentials display their content in ping messages


You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Abyssal Depths has new Geysers for better navigation\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Snowy Forests music\
Simu Simulacrum has ramps. 

Fireworks, Squid Polyp, Drone Parts and Halcyon Seed are now available in Simulacrum.\
Warbanners pop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.

Fixes vanilla bug where Clients don't teleport to the Crab.\
Fixed vanilla bug where Clients often don't get enemy indicators.

### Skins and Mod Support
For technical reasons the skins are their own mod, for more information on the skins go to it's [mod page](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoAlternateSkins/ ):\
They aren't anything too special but I do hope they are still enjoyable.\
[![wolfoAlternateSkins](https://gcdn.thunderstore.io/live/repository/icons/Wolfo-WolfoAlternateSkins-1.5.0.png.128x128_q95.jpg)](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoAlternateSkins/)

This mod depends on [VanillaArtifactsPlus](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/VanillaArtifactsPlus) for balancing Vengance. It's a rather light mod but you can check out the details on it's page.

This mod adds Augments for:\
[Starstorm2](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/), for it's Artifacts and some events it adds. (2 Augments)\
[LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/), for the new artifacts I add there. (4 Augments)\
[WolfoArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoArtifacts), for the new family events I add there. (5 Augments)


#
Report bugs to @Wolfo.wolfo in the Risk of Rain 2 discord or RoR2 Modding discord.\
If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.\
Generally happy about gameplay feedback.

Every player needs this mod installed.

The balance of this mod can be questionable as Simulacrum sucks to balance and is far harder in Multiplayer.\
This mod currently is balanced to be difficult on Monsoon Multiplayer, difficulties like Typhoon and Inferno aren't accounted for.

##
This mod likely breaks [Judgement](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/Judgement/), as at the moment it isn't made with keeping Simulacrum functional in mind.

I already added make wave 50 special so [SimulacrumBossStageMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Def/SimulacrumBossStageMod/) is a bit redundant.\
I already speed up the crab so [SpeedUpSafeWard](https://thunderstore.io/package/Felix/SpeedUpSafeWard/) is redundant.
