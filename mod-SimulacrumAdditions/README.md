## Simulacrum
Starting on wave 50, every stage a ending portal will spawn to end a run peacefully.  
A super boss wave (such as Mithrix) will be forced on wave 50, reoccuring every 30 waves. (they can still occur randomly).  
This makes getting to wave 50 a set goal and makes the gamemode "beatable".  
One of these runs should take around an hour (similiar to loop Mithrix) and counts as a win.  

Adds a large amount of Augments\
Basic Waves:\
-Added 13 Family Event Augments.\
-Added 5 Artifact Augments.\
-Added 3 Elite Augments.\
-Added 7 Item Augments.\
-Added 15 Other Augments.

-In total raises Basic Augment count from 9 to 52 (+8 with supported mods).

Boss Waves:\
-Added 6 Special Boss Augments.\
-Added 4 Aritfact Boss Augments.\
-Added 8 Other Boss Augments.

-In total raises Boss Augment count from 5 to 23 (+2 with supported mods).

Every stage now uses it's own interactable spawn pool to make each stage feel more unique.\
This means Shrine of Chance, Shrine of Woods, Shrine of Order and Cleansing Pools spawn in the game mode.

More enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 21.\
Void enemies are added to the spawn pool starting wave 61.

## Balance
Special Boss Augments now have special scaling like how final bosses on normal runs do.\
Special Boss Augments now spawn with enemies too.\
Mithrix will be in phase 3 during his augment.

Earlier stages reward more money.\
Stage 5+ get less interactables.\
You get more gold and more interactables will spawn in multiplayer

The focus moves faster the more waves are completed.\
For each stage completed, -1 second between regular waves.

Late waves spawn more enemies at the start, leading to bigger enemies but also less time in the wave overall.\
Elites spawn more often the more waves are completed.

Items are now granted every 8 waves until the first red.\
Afterwards every 4 then 2 waves, shortening after each red is added.\
Enemies are no longer granted On Kill items.\
Some overpowered items were blacklisted for enemy team usage. (Tesla Coil, Nkuhanas).

Only 20 enemies can be alive at a time instead of 30.\
Really early waves even less because of how often flying enemies overwhelm the player.

Special waves will get likelier after wave 25 and wave 50.

## Other  
Void Coins can be used as an alternative to blood on void interactables in Simulacrum.\
They drop like Lunar Coin and from Void Barrels. You start with 1.\
Void Blood Payments can no longer be blocked (in Simu)

Adds 2 Simulacrum only Artifacts:\
-Artifact of Augments : Only augmented waves
-Artifact of Reality : Use normal stages instead of Simulacrum stages

Scavengers are given a random Void item in Simulacrum.\
Enemies have a small chance to get a void item.  

There's a void themed teleport effect for the gamemode.  

Void Potential Chests now can present choices from any tier.  
Void Potentials use their respective tiers particle effects.  

The Focus is bigger when moving and expands upon sitting down. This is helps with awkward focus positions in Meadows/Depths. 

You wont encounter your previous stage as your next stage (ie: Meadows -> Sanctuary -> Meadows, no longer happens)

Simu Titanic Plains now plays Void Fields music\
Simu Abyssal Depths now plays Void Locusts music\
Simu Rallypoint Delta now plays Snowy Forests music\
Simu Simulacrum has ramps. 

Fireworks, Squid Polyp, Drone Parts and Halcyon Seed are now available in Simulacrum.\
Warbanners pop on Boss Waves similiar to teleporters.

Fixes vanilla bugs where Clients don't teleport to the Crab.\
Fixed vanilla bugs where Clients often don't get enemy indicators.

Report bugs to @Wolfo.wolfo in the Risk of Rain 2 discord or RoR2 Modding discord.\
If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.\
Generally happy about feedback

Every player needs this mod installed.

The balance of this mod can be questionable as Simulacrum sucks to balance.

Also download my other mods:\
[VanillaArtifactsPlus](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/VanillaArtifactsPlus) for updated vanilla artifacts, noticible in the Augments.  
[WolfoArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoArtifacts) for some fun extra Artifacts and 3 more Artifact augments.  
[LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/) more enemy variety and some small changes and 4 more family augments.  
[WolfoQualityOfLife](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoQualityOfLife/) for many visual improvements.  

##
This mod is likely breaks [Judgement](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/Judgement/), as at the moment it isn't made with keeping normal Simulacrum functional in mind.

I already added make wave 50 special so [SimulacrumBossStageMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Def/SimulacrumBossStageMod/) is a bit redundant.\
I already speed up the crab so [SpeedUpSafeWard](https://thunderstore.io/package/Felix/SpeedUpSafeWard/) is redundant.
